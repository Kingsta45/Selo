## What Was Built

**6 Solidity contracts** (Hardhat, OpenZeppelin, Solidity 0.8.24):

| Contract | Description | Who built |
|---|---|---|
| `MockUSDC.sol` | Mintable ERC-20 used as USDC on the local test network | Jerzy |
| `AgentToken.sol` | ERC-20 per agent with a per-token profit accumulator for profit sharing | Jerzy |
| `AgentVault.sol` | Holds USDC deposits (1 USDC = 1 token), enforces withdrawal cooldown, settles profits | Jerzy |
| `AgentFactory.sol` | Deploys Token + Vault pairs on demand and maintains an on-chain registry | Jerzy |
| `RiskManager.sol` | Stores risk profiles per vault, validates trades, supports halt/resume | Hitesh |
| `PerformanceOracle.sol` | Stores NAV and return snapshots pushed by the backend reporter | Hitesh |
| `AgentMarketplace.sol` | Fixed-price secondary market for buying and selling agent tokens | Hitesh |

**Python backend** (FastAPI + web3py, managed by Poetry):

| File | Description | Who built |
|---|---|---|
| `backend/deploy.py` | One-shot deployment script — deploys all contracts and writes `addresses.json` | Jerzy |
| `backend/web3_client.py` | Web3 connection, ABI loader, `send_tx` helper | Hitesh |
| `backend/routes/trader.py` | `POST /api/trader/create-agent` | Hitesh |
| `backend/routes/investor.py` | `GET /api/investor/agents`, deposit, withdrawal, marketplace buy/sell/cancel | Hitesh |

## How to Run End-to-End

**Prerequisites:** Node.js, npm, Python 3.12+, Poetry

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
poetry install
```

### 2. Compile the contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### 3. Start the local blockchain (keep this terminal open)

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

### 4. Deploy contracts (new terminal)

```bash
poetry run python backend/deploy.py
```

This deploys all contracts, mints test USDC to the Hardhat default accounts, and writes `addresses.json`.

### 5. Start the API server (new terminal)

```bash
poetry run uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```
